            <h1>Communication for Success at Workplace</h1>  
            <p>by Chanda Das, Assistant Professor and Head, Department of Communication, EIILM-Kolkata
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>Communication is a process of interaction and exchange of information between two or more individuals and it is successful <br>
                only when we deliver the message in a clear and understandable manner. Communication is also a dynamic process because it <br>
                involves the mind to process the information and the confidence to face the other and convey the message in an effective way.<br>
                 In other words, it becomes effective only when the intent and content of the message are aligned with the requirements of <br>
                  the target audience.<br><br> 

                  <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>Communication skills involve listening and speaking as well as reading and writing. In the present scenario, expertise in any <br>
                technical skills is just not enough to get the work done at the workplace. It doesn’t matter how good an employee you are. What <br>
                 matters is the working style of an individual. In other words, your career will thrive on your communicable skills or soft skills. <br><br>
                
                 <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i> While working in any organization, you will be part of a project which requires good teamwork. It is with the support of the <br>
                whole team, a task in hand can be completed and executed. At a workplace, the ability to work with superiors, subordinates, <br>
                colleagues, and the peer is the need of the hour. With effective communicative skills, workplace conflicts can be reduced and <br>
                 work will progress in a smoother and enjoyable manner. With a proper ecosystem in place, teamwork will only grow livelier and <br>
                 thrive with positive outcomes. It can create an understanding that can lead to proficiency and accomplishment for 
                 sustainability. <br><br>
                
                To improve on one’s quality of communication, the following are suggested:<br><br>
                
               1. Listen- listen properly to what others have to say by paying close attention to when one is talking. Seek clarification to ensure <br>
                 that you are on the same page. <br><br>


                2.Body language: we communicate not only with our words but also with our body movements- with gestures, postures, tone of our voice, <br>
                 eye contact, facial expression, etc. To understand a spoken communication completely, one has to observe body language that goes with <br>
                  it to infer the right information. <br><br>
                3.Empathy- to be humane is very essential on the part of the employee. If colleagues, peers are treated as a family, the bonding gets stronger. <br><br>
               4. Respect: every individual in the organization should be treated with respect for the roles they perform and also to make them feel that how important <br>
                 they are to the organization and the work they do. <br><br>
               
               5.  Keep communication short and simple by using simple vocabulary and shorter sentences without mincing <br>
                Be humorous at times, to destress and put work stress and anxiety away. <br><br>
                6.Therefore, effective communication is integral for maintaining client relationships and generating sales. <br>
                 Since strong communication helps in leadership skills, all must work towards polishing their skills. </p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>
                In the present scenario, decision science is increasingly making its way into business decision making. Its objective is to control <br>
                 human error and bias. However, the question remains – while we can map the brain, can we map the mind of the market? <br>
                 Should decisions be based only on data crunching? <br><br>


                 <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>  There are major advantages of adopting decision sciences in an organization. It helps businesses make better decisions that are <br>
                 unbiased and data driven. It enables interpretations effective and thus ensuring efficient decisions from huge amounts of data. <br>
                 It also helps analyze the rational value of available alternatives and helps management zero-in on the optimal solution <br><br>


                 <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i> However, decision making is still not robotized and I think probably it will never be. While the big data technology and services <br>
                 market has grown at 23.1% per year in the last 4 years, I believe that use of intuitions, experience, risk taking tendency and <br>
                  other humane aspects will also remain. Situational, political, social, climatic and technological aspects are highly dynamic. So is <br>
                   the fickle emotion of shoppers. It’s difficult to trap these in a systematic model. For example, the relationship between the <br>
                   marketers’ inputs and consumers’ decision is not a simple linear model but a complex web of various antecedents and <br>
                   mediators interacting with each other. Such factors may be cognitive, situational, demographics, psychological etc. On the other <br>
                   hand, in case of routinized response behaviour, no cognitive input is involved. Such decision makings are not easy to understand and predict. <br>
                    It is also true in case of decision making based on heuristics and subliminal motives. This is the challenge of decision science. <br>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>This blog will talk about both the opportunities & challenges in Retail Industry with a special focus in India. The Indian retail <br>
                industry is unique in nature as both Organized and Unorganized types of Retail Outlets are ruling the entire industry by joining <br>
                hands. However, till this early 2021 decade, unorganized retail is overpowering the other one. <br><br>

                <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>  The word “RETAIL’ has been evolved from the French word “RETAILLIER” that means “to break the bulk”; hence RETAIL <br>
                points/Shopping Points/Outlets are such from where end consumers can buy both goods and services for their final consumptions. <br><br>
                
                <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>  Retail industry is known as one of growing industries in India as during 2010 (2001 to 2010) decade in particular, the country <br>
                has witnessed many changes in Indian buying habits as well as in lifestyles. Customers as well as Consumers of India, started <br>
                 accustomed with disposable income, dual income facility for a nuclear family, being attached to Mall Hopping etc. and thus they <br>
                 started becoming the part of organized retail more than unorganized one. However, the urban areas are equipped with the <br>
                 option of big shopping complexes that is known by malls but till date peri-urban as well as rural India is still inclined to <br> 
                 unorganized retail. Therefore, a versatile picture can be seen for Indian retail industry. <br><br>
                
                 <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i> The opportunities are there for both the format based retailers as both of them are getting regular buyers but organized  <br>
                 retailers in specific geographic areas like metro cities and tier1/2 cities in particular are enjoying good amount of sale as <br>
                 because for customers, shopping via organized retail became an entertainment options, too. The population of the country is <br>
                 one of the growth drivers in terms of generating business for unorganized retailers. <br><br>
                
                 <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i> Virtual retailers are doing extremely well during mid of 2020 decade and specifically pandemic helped all E-tailers to grow with <br>
                 their business particularly in 20-21 FY. However most of the areas are not been covered by strong internet coverage hence the <br>
                  predominance of urban areas will prevail, pertaining to the retail sales generated at organized and virtual retail. <br><br>
                
                  <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>Challenges are definitely at rural belt, where the life style and disposable income has not made much impact and literacy level, <br>
                school drop outs etc, cannot influence customers to add value to the Indian organized retail much but with flexibility in FDI <br>
                policies and changes in socio-economic condition of the country can boost more growth in retail industry in upcoming 2030 decade. <br><br>
